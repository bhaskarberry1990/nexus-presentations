== What Are You Learning Today?
:incremental!:

What worked? What caused problems?

-> Apply our lessons to your own situation

== What does Sonatype actually do? 
:incremental!:

Manages and develops:

* Nexus Repository Manager
* Nexus IQ Server
* Nexus IQ Data Services component intelligence
* Central Repository (aka Maven Central)
* OSSRH and related Forges
* Related documentation, websites, blogs, videos,...

== Software Component Warehouse
:incremental!:

Nexus Repository Manager

* 70% market share
* > 50K server installations
* Nexus 3 - distinct new codebase
* Nexus OSS: Maven2, npm, RubyGems, NuGet, Docker, ...
* Commercial: Component Information, Staging, Smart Proxy, User Token, ...

== Software Supply Chain Automation
:incremental!:

Nexus Lifecycle, Nexus Suite, Nexus Firewall

* Nexus IQ Server
* Integrations with Jenkins, Hudson, Bamboo
* Eclipse IDE/M2e Plugin
* SonarQube integration

All of this is backed by... 

== Nexus IQ Data Services
:incremental!:

Curated and managed data and services for:

* Age
* Popularity
* Security vulnerabilities
* License analysis data (observed and declared)
* Multiple component formats

== Central Repository (aka Maven Central)
:incremental!:

* Largest Maven2 format repository
* High performance, global CDN 
* > 17 billion download in 2014
* > 1 million GAV coordinates
* Default in Maven2 and others

And the components come from...

== OSSRH and Forges
:incremental!:

Input funnel for Central Repository

* OSSRH - large deployment of Nexus Repository Manager
* Apache, JBoss, ... - secondary Nexus instances
* Community support - onboarding and documentation

== More OSSRH and Central Stats

* currently about 100k projects total
* approx 3000 new projects each month (GA)
* thats 10 - 30 project verfied and onbarded per day
* approx 30.000 new releases each month (GAV)

== Who Helps at Sonatype
:incremental!:

* Internationally distributed 
* Multiple-time zones
* Remote work the rule, not exception

== Teams
:incremental!:

* Numerous smaller teams
* Different focus of teams
* Cross-team members 

== Process

* Scrum framework
* Kanban inspired
* Backlog refinement
* Regular meetings

image::images/usual-process.png[scale=100]

== Communication
:incremental!:

* Good old phone and VOIP
* Atlassian HipChat
* Google Hangouts
* join.me
* PagerDuty

== SCM
:incremental!:

* GitHub - public and private
* Atlassian Stash - private only

== Track and Plan
:incremental!:

* Atlassian JIRA
* Aha
* Trello
* Basecamp
* Salesforce

== Tools Lesson

* Different people use different tools
* Overlap is inevitable
* Tools come and go - be agile

== Continuous Integration
:incremental!:

* Atlassian Bamboo
* Feature branch builds

== Build
:incremental!:

* Apache Maven
* Grunt and NPM for client side
* Bash Scripts

== Maven Tips and Tricks
:incremental!:

* Maven wrapper
* Follow best practices
* Organizations POM
* Enforcer
* Avoid forking third party libraries
* But do it cleanly when necessary


== Project Complexity

Find balance for

* Number vs Size of projects
* Multi-module vs multiple projects
* Consider Release Cycle

TIP: Example Nexus OSS and Pro

== Develop
:incremental!:

* Feature branches
** with CI
** short lived
* IDE
** Eclipse IDE
** IntelliJ IDEA
* Lots of OSX, some Windows & Linux

== Test
:incremental!:

Unit, functional and manual

* Junit
* Geb
* Spock

== Document
:incremental!:

* Atlassian Confluence
* Google Docs
* Asciidoc
* Pelican

== Continuously Build
:incremental!:

* Atlassian Bamboo
* > 100 build plans
* Elastics Bamboo - EC2 instances
* Feature branch builds increases number
* Automated functional test suite runs
* Automated release
* Documentation builds and deployments

== Bamboo Tips
:incremental!:

* Resource project (link to video maybe)
* Fresh Maven repo for each build off Nexus

* Build plan notifications into HipChat channels
* Links to GitHub and JIRA 


== More Bamboo Tips
:incremental!:

* Share repo and other outputs as build artifacts
* Static documentation = usable artifact
* Limited number of standard Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
* Include standard tools
* Build artifacts stored on Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
* Base build plan with tool configuration\

== Build Plan Commonalities

All builds plans:

* Common configuration from base plan - used as shared artifact, managed in git repo
* Global variables - defaults that allow overrides
* 'build' task - compile and test code.
* 'release' task - publish to Nexus and tag in git
* bundle test artifacts
* Main vs features branches - different config
* Branch builds auto-created

Repository manager 

* component source for consumers
* component target for producers

== Co-Locate For Performance

Continuous integration is consumer and producer.

Best practice: 

* Get it close together
* And sync to another repository if needed. 

image::images/nexus-bamboo-rso.png[scale=100]

== Validate
:incremental!:

* SonarQube - integrated in Bamboo and GitHub
* License check with Maven plugin
* No merges without build passing and code review 
* Component policy with Nexus Lifecycle

== Release
:incremental!:

* Workflow and notification with Nexus staging
* Including validation with Nexus Lifecycle
** Security checks
** License checks
** ?? anything else, maybe component age

* Usage of release build number - `2.11.4-01`

* Same release stuff on OSSRH

image::images/nexus-bamboo-staging.png[scale=100]

== Manage Components
:incremental!:

Nexus Repository Manager and Nexus Lifecycle
Nexus Repository Manager 
* SNAPSHOT versions of master are deployed to Nexus
* feature branch versions are not deployed
* master = integration branch
* within build cluster
* also used by developers
* target for deployments
* proxy 
* host 
* staging
* Thousands of users and projects on OSSRH
* smart proxy to Nexus outside cluster


== Black and White Listing

Wont work .. tbd

== Golden Repository 

wont work

== Nexus Lifecycle 

* Visualize risk through rule-based automation
* Streamlines component selection with real time data

== Starting Off

* Define risks we care about (internal, external, customer used)
* Open source contributions change out policy (since we contribute it makes sense to use bleeding edge)
* Understand our process and tooling
* limit overhead in our build automation

== Nexus IQ Server Deployment

image::images/nexus-iq-server-integration.png[scale=100]

== Policy

image::images/sonatype-policy.png[scale=100]


== Resulting Report

image::images/nexus-clm-report.png[scale=100]

== Nexus Lifecycle Lessons

* Surprise how many components are used - so many!
* Blocking a release for policy violations
** is a big stick
** but it works


Expect some cleanup of old issues

Socialize the resolution/enforcement process

Low noise and fast results increases usage, adoption

Automate and let the tooling do work (I already have a day job!)

Be responsive (That is my day job!)


== Perimeter Protection

is Nexus Firewall. Can help

== Deploy

Ops team:

* RPMs
* Docker images

== Support

[Quote]
The support team consistes of engineers. 

* Write lots of automation and other code
* Atlassian JIRA
* ZenDesk 

== Operations

* SaaS is used whenever possible
* Kanban process
* iDoneThis

TIP: Our Nexus instances vary from hundreds of GB to terabytes of non-proxied context.


== Operations - Service Management

Nexus as component warehouse with Ansible

image::images/service-management.png[scale=100]

== Community
:incremental!:

* Actively work with vendors
* Including open source projects
* Help upstream to help yourself
** Report issues
** Release testing
** Contributions

== Next?
:incremental!:

* Join the http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/[Nexus community]
* Star using Nexus OSS
* Try Nexus Repository Manager
* Try Nexus Lifecycle
* Come to our booth
