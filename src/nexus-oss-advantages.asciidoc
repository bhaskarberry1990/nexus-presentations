== So What is a Component?

* All the stuff you use to create your applications 

* The plumbing you don't want to write yourself

* Logging, IoC, persistence layer, ORM, ... 

* And that you get easily by declaring dependencies with Maven,
  Gradle, NuGet, npm... 

* Comprises 80-90% of your application

WARNING: And you are responsible for it all. 

== So What is a Component?

* But also all the parts you create and use 

** Including the application deployment packages

* JARs, WARs, EARs..

**  but also rpm and npm packages or tar.gz files

== What is a Repository?

* Organized storage  for components

* Uses e.g. GAV coordinates for structure

-> A *Component Manager* helps with administration and usage of
   components stored in repositories

TIP: Just like a Git server helps you manage source code in Git repositories

== Problems Without Component Manager

* Common complaint "Maven/Gradle/npm/NuGet is downloading the internet, again!"

* Everything is cached locally (e.g. in ~/.m2/repository) 

* Components are used from local repo in *all* your projects

* But new versions or new components trigger downloads

** E.g. 500 developers and 500 CI nodes = 1000
   downloads

** Global bank reduced from 2.6 millon to 90k downloads

** That's a lot of wasted bandwidth and *time*

* How do I use the x.y.z proprietary component - I can't find it in
the Central Repository (or wherever)?

* How do I share my components with the other teams? 

TIP: This is where Sonatype Nexus can help!


== Component Manager Tasks

Nexus is a dedicated server software:

It is used to...

* Proxy and manage access to public repositories

* Store components that are *not* in public repositories

* Manage and host internal releases

* Distribute components internally and beyond

->  Facilitate internal collaboration across components and teams


=== Component Usage Growth...

is exploding. And so is usage of Nexus.
