== What Are You Gonna Learn Today?

* Interesting facts and figures
* A new perspective about your development efforts
* Lots of simple steps for improvements

== Data Sources
:incremental!:

* Central Repository usage statistics
** A.k.a. Maven Central
** Largest binary repository
** Running for 10+ years
** Sponsored and managed by Sonatype

* Sonatype Nexus usage statistics 
** Most commonly use repository manager
** >50k installations

== Research Reports
:incremental:

* 2011-2014 Open Source Software Development Survey
** >11k responses
* 2015 State of the Software Supply Chain Report 

== How We Develop Today

* Use components as building blocks

* Enjoy power of reuse and collaboration 

* Software stack doesn't matter - all use components

* Open source FTW everywhere! 

== Guess...
:incremental:

What is the percentage of components in a typical application?

TIP: 80-90%

== Estimate...
:incremental:

How many components can be found in an average application? 

TIP:  More than 100 !

== So What is a Component?
:incremental:

____
Frameworks, Libraries, ... Plumbing you don't want to write yourself. Like 
Logging, IoC, persistence layer, ORM, widgets,... 
____

You get them easily by declaring dependencies with Maven, Gradle, nuget, npm... 

== What is a Component?
:incremental!:

Third party AND everything you create

* JARs, WARs, EARs..
* rpm, deb 
* npm, nupkg, gem packages 
* zip, tar.gz files
* installer packages, docker images
* ...

== Software Supply Chain
:incremental:

Just like for traditional manufacturing

* Understand complete inventory of your product
* Including origin (suppliers)
* And usage 

== Software Supply Chain Management
:incremental:

Components are integral part of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

It is an endless circle of activities: 

* Research what components to use
* Implement usage of components in development
* Check component usage in QA and release process
* Monitor applications and components used in production
* Go back to the start and change versions or entire components

== So what do you think...  
:incremental:

When do software supply chain management efforts stop?

TIP: When all production deployments are turned off!

WARNING:  *Not* when development stops.

== Supply Chain Best Practices
:incremental!:

* Better and fewer suppliers
* Higher quality parts
* Improved visibility and traceability

== Best Practice: Select Projects
:incremental:

TIP: Open source projects are your suppliers!

* Large vs small project
* Active vs inactive in terms of commits
* Foundation backed or stand alone project
* Commercial company backing or not
* Active community and support

== Best Practice: Communicate with Suppliers
:incremental:

* Most often open source project
* Report bugs and feature requests
* Help with documentation
* Be present on mailing lists, forums, IRC, ...
* Attend events

== Best Practice: Support Suppliers
:incremental:

* Promote project via presentations, ...
* Become a committer
* Sponsor a committer
* Provide infrastructure
* Sponsor foundations
* Pay for support

== Best Practice: Reduce Vendors
:incremental:

Each additional vendor

* Adds integration complexity
* Adds communication channels
* Add need for tracking
* Add new APIs to learn
* Adds license terms to understand
* ...

TIP: So having less is easier. 


== Now..
:incremental:

That we know that we use *lots* of components 

Where do we get them from? 

== Public Repositories as Warehouses/Distributors
:incremental:

Very important in their eco-systems

* JVM - Central Repository - 17B downloads in 2014
** up from 500 M in 2007
* JavaScript/Node - npmjs.org - 15B downloads in 2014
* Ruby - rubygems.org - 5B downloads since inception
* .Net - NuGet Gallery - 300m downloads in 2014

== Example: Central Repository
:incremental:

* Approx 1 Million open source components
* Approx 11 Million users
* 1000 new components added daily
* Exponential growth 

TIP: Growth of other repositories is similar

== Best Practice: Control Component Source
:incremental:

TIP: Run your own local warehouse!

* Reduced bandwidth usage and costs
* Improve performance and stability
* Internal caching and storing of components -> enables collaboration
* Reduced dependency on external repositories
* One component storage location for backup, audit, control...
* Store your own components centrally

-> Use a *repository manager*! 

== Guess...
:incremental:

Are people following this easily implemented best practice? 
____
TIP: No!
____

* 95% of downloads from Central Repository -> build tools,...
* Only 5% via repository manager
* 18 % of respondents to component survey use *no* repository manager

== Sonatype Nexus as Central Hub
:incremental!:
  
image::images/nexus-tool-suite-integration.png[scale=100]

-> Nexus is a key component of your enterprise development
  infrastructure

== Repository Management with Nexus OSS
:incremental:

* Used by 64% of repository manager users

* Formats include Maven, NuGet, NPM, site, Yum and Gems

-> Way better than manual management or ignoring the need

IMPORTANT: Yet easy to implement... and open source!

== Best Practice: Know Your Components
:incremental:

* Look at your build files
* Crack open the deployment archive
* Identify with checksum search

WARNING: You will be surprised what you find!

== Best Practice: Know Their Dependencies
:incremental:

* `mvn dependency:tree` or similar analysis
* Dependency Hierarchy in M2Eclipse or Nexus Pro
* Challenge yourself to produce a Bill of Materials

TIP: Demo time!

== Best Practice: Avoid Duplication
:incremental:

* Multiple logging frameworks
* Multiple web frameworks
* Multiple technology stacks

TIP: But still don't be afraid of using what is best for the job. Find the right balance.

== Best Practice: Reduce Their Numbers
:incremental:

* KISS[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle]
* Less complexity
* Less learning effort
* Less tracking updates, issues, communication, ...

== Room for Improvement
:incremental:

Sonatype Application Health Check analysis of 1500+ applications

* On average 106 components
* 24 with known vulnerabilities
* 9 with restrictive licenses

== Guess... 
:incremental:

How many versions of each library are used at Google? 

TIP: One or two mandated in most cases!

== Step: Upgrade Often
:incremental:

* just like devops - release often
* reduces complexity of updates
* open source projects work on master - latest == best, nearly always, avoid issues easily
* especially regarding security issues, backports are rare!
* sometimes you will get burned with regressions

* Typical component 3-4 releases per year

Average org downloads from Central - top 100 components, 27 are outdated and newer versions exists






WARNING: And you are responsible for *all* components used in your application! 



== Best Practice: Know Component Security Characteristics
:incremental:

tbd

Average org 250k different component downloads per year
15k components with known vulnerabilities downloaded
some of them probably are used in production apps

46 million vulnerable components downloaded in 2014 from Central

16% must prove they are not using known security vulnerabilities

New vulnerabilities found regularly, new releases all the time - yet 63 % do NOT monitor for changes in vulnerability data

How would you know? A PITA to find out

approx 50K components in Central have known security vulnerabilities

OWASP dependency check 

Show in Nexus Pro

== Best Practice: Understand License Implications
:incremental:

63 % have incomplete view of license risk from components

Only 32 % examine all open source components for license compliance

58 % say they are no concerned about license risk

approx 280k components in Central have restrictive licenses
tbd


== Next Steps
:incremental:

Define policies e.g. 

* No components older than 5 years
* No components with know security vulnerabilities of score > 8
* No GPL licensed components



* Only 56 % have policies
* Of these only 68% follow policy
* Often manual, slow
* But 78% say they have never banned a component
* Things do not add up.. 



== Next Steps
:incremental:

* Add tools to automate the process

* Configure tools with policies

== Aim of Tools
:incremental:

1. Empower developers with the right information at the right time

2. Design frictionless, automated approach for continuous DevOps processes

3. Create, manage and monitor component bill of materials for each application

== Bill of Material
:incremental:

* Tracking productions applications BOM
** 40% including dependencies
** 23% NOT including dependencies

== Example Tools
:incremental:
lots of them out there for different stacks, examples to follow

* Dependency Plugin
* Dependency Management
* BOM POM file
* M2e - effective POM view, dependency view
* OWASP Dependency Check 



== Sonatype Nexus Pro

* component info
* RHC
* search

== Nexus Pro+
:incremental:

In a nutshell:

* Configurable component policies - *very* powerful

* Managed on the Sonatype CLM server

* Tied into Nexus staging

TIP: Demo time!

== Sonatype Nexus Lifecycle
:incremental:

Expands Nexus Pro+
