=== Tips for Viewing

The html files in the root folder are all you need to show the
presentations. They are self-contained and ready to be used on any
browser.

The PDF files are just for being able to print, if desired. 

Find some example material in the +labs+ folder.

Just download the repo with git clone or as zip/tar.gz

Documentation for writing or using the presentations can be found at 
https://code.google.com/p/asciidoc-slidy2-backend-plugin/.
