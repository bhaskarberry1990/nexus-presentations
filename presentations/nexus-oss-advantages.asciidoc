== So What is a Component?

* All the stuff you use to create your applications 

* The plumbing you don't want to write yourself

* Logging, IoC, persistence layer, ORM, ... 

* And that you get easily by declaring dependencies with Maven,
  Gradle, NuGet, npm... 

* Comprises 80-90% of your application

WARNING: And you are responsible for it all. 

== So What is a Component?

* But also all the parts you create and use 

** Including the application deployment packages

* JARs, WARs, EARs..

**  but also rpm and npm packages or tar.gz files

== What is a Repository?

* Organized storage  for components

* Uses e.g. GAV coordinates for structure

-> A *Component Manager* helps with administration and usage of
   components stored in repositories

== Problems Without Component Manager

* Common complaint "Maven/Gradle/npm is downloading the internet, again!"

* Everything is cached locally (e.g. in ~/.m2/repository) 

* Components are used from local repo in *all* your projects

* But new versions or new components trigger downloads

** For everyone ... e.g. 500 developers and 500 CI nodes = 1000
   downloads from Central Repository

* How do I use the x.y.z proprietary component - I can't find it in
the Central Repository (or wherever)?

* How do I share my components with the other teams? 

TIP: This is where Sonatype Nexus can help!


== Component Manager Tasks

Component manager like Nexus OSS is a dedicated server software:

* Proxy and manage access to public repositories

* Store components that are not in public repositories

* Manage internal releases and development components

->  Facilitate internal collaboration across components and teams


== Nexus OSS

* 64 % marketshare among component managers

* Eclipse licensed

* Large community of users

* add footnote to JRebel survey

* TBD

== Getting Started - Nexus OSS

Installation is simple:

. Install Java 7

. Get the bundle with the embedded Eclipse Jetty server

. Extract archive, create symbolic link and run
+
----
sudo cp nexus-professional-x.y.z-bundle.tar.gz /usr/local
cd /usr/local
sudo tar xvzf nexus-professional-x.y.z-bundle.tar.gz
ln -s nexus-professional-x.y.z nexus
cd nexus
./bin/nexus console
----

. Go to http://localhost:8081/nexus and log in with admin/admin123

TIP:  Let's have a look..

-> It's easy and the benefits are immediate.

No matter if you build your software with Gradle, Ant, Maven, or
another tool, youâ€™re using lots of open source components from
external repositories. To speed up the build, improve reuse of your
own components, and simplify management of all those components, you
should be using a repository manager. Sonatype Nexus is the mostly
widely used repository manager. This session presents a quick overview
of Nexus usage and shows you features that make it the most powerful
open source repository manager. The presentation also checks out
basics such as hosted and proxy repositories as well as group
repositories and goes further by examining features such as support
for site repositories, RPM/Yum repositories, and NuGet
repositories. It also discusses integrating Nexus with other tools.
