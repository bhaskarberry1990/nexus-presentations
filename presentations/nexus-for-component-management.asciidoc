== Nexus for Component Management

Join me on a journey

* from no component manager usage

* to full software development lifecycle integration 

WARNING: Hold on tight. This is going to be a whirlwind trip.

== Nexus for Component Management

We will move ...

* from using unknown jar files

* dependencies not being understood

* and brittle version updates 

to

* enforced policies

* well understood component usage

* avoided security and license issues


== Nexus for Component Management

We will move ...

* from using e.g. jars checked into version control

* or just using Maven, Gradle, ... out of the box

* via Nexus OSS

* to Nexus Professional 

* and onwards to Nexus Professional CLM Edition

* to Sontype CLM with all its tools 

** for IDE, 

** CI 

** and more

== But What About the Top Ten Tips?

Don't worry. I got this covered. There will be lots of tips and tricks.

== And What About My Questions?

Go right ahead - ask any time. 

But first, let me set the stage...

== So What is a Component?

* All the stuff you use to create your applications 

* The plumbing you don't want to write yourself

* Logging, IoC, persistence layer, ORM, ... 

* And that you get easily by declaring dependencies with Maven,
  Gradle, nuget, npm... 

* Comprises 80-90% of your application

WARNING: And you are responsible for it all. 

== So What is a Component?

* But also all the parts you create and use 

** Including the application deployment packages

* JARs, WARs, EARs..

**  but also rpm and npm packages or tar.gz files

== Development Lifecycle Integration? 

It is an endless circle of activities: 

* Research what components to use

* Implement usage of components in development

* Check component usage in QA and release process

* Monitor applications and components used in production

* Go back to the start and change versions or entire components

WARNING: It only ends when any production deployments are
decommissioned and *not* when development stops.

== Getting Started - Nexus OSS

* Installation is simple

** Extract archive and run

* Configuration

** conf/nexus.properties

** bin/nexus(.bat)

* Run as a service (JSW)

** bin/jsw/conf/wrapper.conf

TIP:  Let's have a look at these files.

-> It's easy and the benefits are immediate. 

== What is a Repository?

* Organized storage and access container for components

* Uses e.g. GAV coordinates for structure

-> A Compoent Manager helps with administration and usage of
   components stored in repositories

== Component Manager Tasks

* Proxy and manage access to public repositories

* Store components that are not in public repositories

* Manage internal releases and development components

->  Facilitate internal collaboration across components and teams

== Repository Concepts

* Proxy and hosted repositories

* Repository groups for easy access/aggregation

* Maven 2, NuGet and NPM  

TIP: We explore all that in the user interface.


== Security

* Privileges, roles and users

* External role mappings e.g. LDAP

* Repository targets

* Authentication from tools 

** settings.xml and more

TIP: Understanding security and possible setups is crucial to control
component usage.

== Search & Component Information

* Different search methods

* Find components in different repositories

* Find available versions - not yet used

** Useful for component selection

* GAV coordinates and repository location

TIP: Demo time! 

== Component Management

'Supply change management for components'

* Security and authentication

* Repositories and repository targets

* Component information

->  Set the stage for first repository and component management

== Component Management

Who can read? 

* other teams (QA, operations)

* remote offices

* contractors, partner companies, public access 

== Component Management

Who can write?

* Build master

* Release engineers

* CI servers

* SNAPSHOTS vs. release

== Component Management

What information is available to whom?

* development

* QA

* security

* legal

* ...

== Component Management with Nexus OSS

* Internal caching and storing of components -> enables collaboration

* Reduced dependency on external repositories

* One component storage location for backup, audit, control...

* Highly performant 

* Reduced bandwitdh usage and costs

* Efficient search 

* Repository Health Check

* Some meta data

* Formats include Maven, NuGet, NPM, site, Yum and JRuby/Gems

-> Way better than manual management or ignoring the need

IMPORTANT: Yet easy to implement...

== Managing Nexus

* Logging

* Support tools

* Scheduled tasks

* System feeds

* JMX

* External monitoring software

== Nexus Professional - More Information

Lots more component information:

* Archive browser and Maven dependency

* Age & popularity

* Security information

* License Information

* Repository health check with component details

TIP: You gotta see this!

== Nexus Professional - More Security

More security features:

* User token

* Enterprise LDAP, Atlassian Crowd

* SSL management

* Maven settings management

== Sonatype Nexus as Center Hub

-> Nexus is a key component of your enterprise development
  infrastructure


== Scaling Nexus Deployments

* One server

* Bigger server..

* With failover setup

* Multiple server for read, single write

* With load balancer

== Scaling Nexus Deployments

With Nexus Professional -> Smart proxy

image::images/nexus-smart-proxy.png[scale=100]

TIP: This is used for sync to OSSRH and Central from e.g. JBoss,
Apache,...

== Release Process 

* Security controls write access

* Configurable with repository targets

** Disallow deployments outside company GAV

** Specific GAV's allowed per team

** Or only CI server can deploy

** Or build master

== Release Process 

Dedicated tooling for release process in Nexus Professional - Staging

* Temporary repository

* Rule validation upon deployment

* Configurable for repository targets

* Security controlled stages

* Used as input funnel for Central Repository - OSSRH

== Nexus Professional CLM Edition
In a nutshell:

* Configurable component policies - *very* powerful

* Managed on the Sonatype CLM server

* Tied into Nexus Staging

TIP: Demo time!

== Sonatype CLM

Expands CLM Nexus Professional CLM Edition 

* Manual analysis in CLM server
 
* Eclipse IDE integration

* Continuous Integration Server support

* SonarQube support

* Command line scanning

== Integrating with Nexus

* Lots of build tools can integrate with Maven repositories 

** Ant/Ivy, Gradle, SBT, Grails Leiningen, ...

* Lots of other repository formats support

* All functionality is available in REST API

* Java Client for REST API available

* Plugin architecture with examples to create your own

TIP: Check out the community chapter in the Nexus book.
