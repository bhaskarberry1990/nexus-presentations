== Development Today

Uses components. Lots of them. 

* Facilitate the power of open source

* Don't reinvent the wheel

A component is any artifact or library that your software needs in
order to be built, released and to run

== Manual Dependency Management

* Painful

* Unreliable

* Overloads SCM

== Declarative Dependency Managment

* Automatic

* Including transitive dependencies

* Maven is downloading the internet, again!

* So are all the other tools, and all use

** Central Repository

** Maven repository format


== Maven Repository Format

groupId, artifactId, version, classifier, packaging

add examples






== Adoption Stages and Advantages

* Proxy external repositories

** Starting with Central Repository

** Reduced downloads, faster builds, increased stability

* Host external and internal artifacts

** Deploy once for everybody

** Share binary components like open source projects

** Improve cooperation between multiple, different teams (dev, qa,
   ops...)

* Lifecycle Integration

** Addition of CI server

** Controlling component usage - Procurement

** Improving release process - Staging

* Gaining license and security understanding of the components
